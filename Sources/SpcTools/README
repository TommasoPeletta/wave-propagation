    Utility Library based on PELABS by Alexandre Dupuis
            with the help of Stephane Marconi
          SPC group, CUI, University of Geneva

First untar the library: tar -xvf spcTool.tar

In order to work, the X11 development file must be installed.
By default they are not on Ubuntu systems. Install the library
                libx11-dev
with either the synaptic package manager or with 
          sudo apt-get install libx11-dev


Then, to compile the library:

    cd SpcTools
    make clean

then:

    make


The directory Spc/Tools/Example gives some programs illustrating how to
use the library, namely cellular automata simulation and function plots. 

Compile them using the given Makefile:
 
                   make parity

or
                   make plotExple

Note: The DISPLAY environment variable should be set properly
      e.g   setenv DISPLAY :0   to display on  the local machine

For documentation on how to use the library, read
               spcTools.pdf
